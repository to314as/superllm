## 🚀 Installation

```bash
pip install superllm
```

## 🔧 Quick Start

```python
from superllm import ThoughtTree, ExpertFeedback
from superllm.search import AdaptiveBeamSearch

# Initialize a thought tree for complex reasoning
thought_tree = ThoughtTree()

# Create an expert feedback system
expert_system = ExpertFeedback()

# Configure adaptive beam search
search = AdaptiveBeamSearch(
    beam_width=5,
    max_steps=10
)

# Run enhanced inference
result = thought_tree.solve(
    prompt="Your complex question here",
    search_algorithm=search,
    expert_system=expert_system
)
```
